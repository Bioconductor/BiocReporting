# DRAFT (due to submit to R Journal on Friday, Feb 24 2023)


# Introduction 

[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org) provides
tools for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic
data.  The project has entered its twentieth year, with funding
for core development and infrastructure maintenance secured
through 2025 (NIH NHGRI 2U24HG004059).  Additional support is provided
by NIH NCI, Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, National Science Foundation,
Microsoft, and Amazon.  In this news report, ....TODO
 
# Software

The current Bioconductor release is [3.16](https://bioconductor.org/news/bioc_3_16_release/). It is
compatible with R 4.2 and consists of 2183 software packages, 416
experiment data packages, 909 up-to-date annotation packages, 28
workflows, and 3 books. \href{https://bioconductor.org/books/release/}{Books} are
built regularly from source and therefore fully
reproducible; an example is the
community-developed [Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/).


# Core team updates

TODO: Any things to add? (below from CAB doc)

## Default Branch Renaming

The default branch (that corresponds to Bioconductor devel version) will be renamed to devel on git.bioconductor.org for all packages to move forward with diversity and inclusiveness.  The core has been doing extensive testing and is ready to move forward within the next 2-3 weeks.  

Maintainers will temporarily still be able to push to either devel or master to allow time for adaptation, with the goal of eventually making it an error in maybe 2-3 release cycles (1-1.5 years) 
We will be making announcements on bioc-devel mailing list, Twitter, Mastodon, Slack, etc with an upcoming/heads up and an announcement when it is live.

## Partnering with Outreachy

Bioconductor participated as a mentoring community in Outreachy's December 2022
- March 2023 internship round. [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) provides
open source and open science internships to individuals impacted by systemic
bias and underrepresentation in tech. Bioconductor received funding for two
interns through Outreachy's general fund for two projects. Kirabo Atuhurira,
a software engineering student from Kampala, Uganda, was chosen to work on the
[BSgenomeForge](https://github.com/Bioconductor/BSgenomeForge), which attempts
to simplify making Bsgenome data packages. Beryl Kanali, a masters student
from Nairobi, Kenya, was chosen to work on
[Sweave2Rmd](https://github.com/Bioconductor/sweave2rmd), which attempts to
modernize Sweave vignettes by converting them into R Markdown. You can read more
about their experience at [Our experience as Outreachy interns with
Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.github.io/biocblog/posts/2023-01-22-OutreachyInternship/).

Bioconductor will also participate in Outreachy's May 2023 - August 2023
internship round to offer internships with Bioconductor community projects.


# Conferences

The BioC2023 and EuroBioC2023 conferences have both been announced, and abstract submissions are open. BioC Asia will be announced later this year.

- [Our experience as Outreachy interns with Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.github.io/biocblog/posts/2023-01-22-OutreachyInternship/)  
Bioconductor participated in the Outreachy Internship program for the December 2022 cohort. Our interns share their experience working on their various projects and Bioconductor in general.

- [Bioconductor Hacktoberfest 2022 review and looking ahead to 2023](https://bioconductor.github.io/biocblog/posts/2023-01-20-hacktoberfest/)  
Last October, Bioconductor joined Hacktoberfest and got great community contributions there. Here, we describe its success and notify the community we plan to participate in 2023.


# Boards updates

## Community Advisory Board

# Using Bioconductor

Start using
Bioconductor by installing the most recent version of R and evaluating
the commands
```
  if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
      install.packages("BiocManager")
  BiocManager::install()
```

Install additional packages and dependencies,
e.g., [SingleCellExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SingleCellExperiment), with
```
  BiocManager::install("SingleCellExperiment")
```
[Docker](https://bioconductor.org/help/docker/)
images provides a very effective on-ramp for power users to rapidly
obtain access to standardized and scalable computing environments.
Key resources include:

- A community slack workspace ([sign up](https://slack.bioconductor.org))
   for extended technical discussion.
- The [F1000Research Bioconductor gateway](https://f1000research.com/gateways/bioconductor)
for peer-reviewed Bioconductor workflows as well as conference contributions.
- The [Bioconductor YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/bioconductor)
     channel includes recordings of keynote and talks from recent 
     conferences including BioC2022, EuroBioC2022, and BiocAsia2021, in addition to 
     video recordings of training courses.

  repository for open technical review of new packages.

Upcoming and recently completed conferences are browsable at our
[events page](https://bioconductor.org/help/events/).

The [Technical](https://bioconductor.org/about/technical-advisory-board/)
and and [Community](https://bioconductor.org/about/community-advisory-board/)
Advisory Boards provide guidance to ensure that the project addresses
leading-edge biological problems with advanced technical approaches,
and adopts practices (such as a
project-wide [Code of Conduct](https://bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/)
that encourages all to participate. We look forward to
welcoming you!
